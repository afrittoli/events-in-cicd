# The Single Tool
(diagram with Git*, Tekton, Jenkins, Keptn, ArgoCD)

<!--
Organisation often find one single tool that
satisfies all their needs of CI/CD... or not really
-->

----

# The single Protocol
(same diagram plus various protocols)

<!--
And these different platforms all speak the same
language... or not really again
-->

---

## Event driven

* Decoupled integration
* Scalability
* Resiliency

<!-- 
Discuss the benefits of event driven integration
between the various platforms.
-->

----

...but requires point to point integrations:

<!--
Platform X reacts to events from platform Y
Platform X understand terminology from platform Y
-->

----

Sometimes lost in translation

* Workflow
* Pipeline
* Build
* Task
* Step 

----

Standardization?

### Continuous Delivery Foundation

Enter CDF, a neutral home of CI/CD projects

## Interoperability SIG

see [The road to interoperability in CI/CD](https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/the_road_to_interoperability_in_ci_cd/) @ FOSDEM 2021

> highlight and promote the needs of the users who face challenges constructing complex end-to-end CI/CD flows and pipelines by employing different tools and technologies
